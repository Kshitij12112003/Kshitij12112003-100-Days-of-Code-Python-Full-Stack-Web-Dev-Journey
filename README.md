# Kshitij12112003-100-Days-of-Code-Python-Full-Stack-Web-Dev-Journey

Welcome to my 100 Days of Code Challenge, running from May 18 to August 25, 2025!
In this repository, I’m documenting my journey through an intensive Python and Full-Stack Web Development bootcamp. Every day, I learn something new — and then build a project to apply it.
This challenge includes 100+ real-world projects, spanning automation, web scraping, game development, GUI apps, data science, APIs, and full-stack web apps.

As part of the #100DaysOfCode challenge, I'm committing to code for at least one hour every day for 100 days. Each day, I:
* Study a new concept or tool
* Build a small or medium-sized project to apply what I’ve learned
* Share my progress right here in this repository
